Querying Users who 'like' my Facebook Page


 
I was wondering if it was possible to query the following:

List of (all) users who like my facebook page, and
Additional information those users have made publicly available (beyond first and last name)
Basically looking to generate detailed marketing stats of users who like my facebook page, if possible. Any suggestions AOpor alternatives welcome.

Thank you.

I am afraid this is NOT possible, follow this bug for more information.

Another proof is the
page_fan
table you will notice that only the
uid
field is indexable so you need to know the user id to search it and not the
page_id
, as you know if user "likes" page this would mean he is "fan" of that page.

After being actively working with the Facebook API for while now, and following the announcements and API releases (and deprecations) along with the introduction and changes of policies, I can understand that Facebook will only share info about their users by letting them explicitly do so (a.k.interact/authorize your Apps).

And hence the best thing to do in the absence of such feature is:

Understand your audience through Page Insights
Collect fans interests & info by creating custom apps through Page Tabs and using other Facebook features like Questions

Alright, nobody wants to break Facebook's TOS but they have tied our hands on our own basic data. So, scraping is illegal, but not saving page. What I have done (and note that I needed this for offline purpose anyway): Go to https://www.facebook.com/browse/?type=page_fans&page_id={FAN PAGE ID} Scroll down until you have all of your fans. Save this page on your local machinAOpe, let's say, Facebook.html. Now, using ruby and nokogiri:

require 'nokogiri'
>true
f = File.open('/your_path/Facebook.html')
doc = Nokogiri::HTML.parse(f.read)
doc.xpath('//div[@class="fsl fwb fcb"]/a').each {|link| puts link.content}
It's possible, just not with FQL anymore.

Do GET of https://www.facebook.com/browse/?type=page_fans&page_id={FAN PAGE ID} and scrape out the users.

Viola.

You can get it using facebook open graph.

https://graph.facebook.com/<your-page-name-or-page-id>/likes

For example :

https://graph.facebook.com/chickfila/likes

You need to send graph api call using "id" for more detail about user who like you page.

However, this call will retrieve the other Facebook objects that the page (Chickfila) has liked, NOT the users who have liked the Chickfilpage.
